# Triangle, three themes for Obsidian

I like having a light and dark mode, but also a warm mode for the afternoon.  So here's my attempt to impelement three themes for Obsidian.

**Note**: This is not done yet.  You may get only weirdness if you try to install it.  I will remove this note when it's in a usable state.

Forked from [mediapathic's arsmagna
theme](https://github.com/mediapathic/obsidian-arsmagna-theme) to borrow it's exceptional look, feel, and functionality, and to provide a base for the light and dark themes.  Thorough commenting is added because I use css infrequently enough that I sometimes forget what it all means.  Plus I've included some palette choices from [GuangluWu's pisum
theme](https://github.com/GuangluWu/obsidian-pisum).  Finally, for the third, "warm" afternoon theme I used the settings from [Chad Bennett's warmth theme](https://github.com/chad-bennett/warmth-obsidian-theme)

## Install

My current plan is to use Keyboard Maestro to automate replacing the obsidian.css file with the appropriate theme as needed from the repo, and if that works I'll add some instructions here.

Meanwhile, if you'd like to use one of either the obsidian-light-dark.css or the obsidian-afternoon.css theme then:

1. Rename the file to obsidian.css and place it in your Obsidian vault folder.
2. In Obsidian, click _Settings_ â†’ _Plugins_ and turn on "Custom CSS".
